# Customer Segmentation Project
This repo contains the Customer Segmentation project as part of my Data Science portfolio. The project documents the steps to implement customer segmentation in Python 3 code. The segmentation technique used in this project is known as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.  RFM analysis is a behaviour-based approach of grouping customers into segments or clusters, based on their previous purchase transactions i.e. how recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. 

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** website. It is a transactional dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retailer.
